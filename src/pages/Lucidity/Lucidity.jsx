          I had the oppurtunity to collaborate with a talented group to build
          Lucidity, a tutoring app designed with React Native. While
          contributing to both the front-end and back-end, my primary focus was
          crafting a responsive and visually appealing user interface. For the
          backend, I worked with Supabase, ensuring a smooth and efficient data
          flow. This project was a testament to teamwork and my ability to
          bridge design and functionality effectively.
