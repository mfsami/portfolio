          I took on the challenge of building a website for a local soccer
          tournamet. The project began with a comprehensive design phase in
          Figma, ensuring every detail was thoughtfully planned. Developed using
          React.js, using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the
          website prioritized user-friendly navigation and a visually cohesive
          layout. This project showcased my ability to transform designs into a
          functional, engaging platform while maintaining a sharp focus on
          usability and aesthetics.
